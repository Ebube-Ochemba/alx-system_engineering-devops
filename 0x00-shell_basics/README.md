# Shell Basics

> This project was an introduction to the Shell.

## Introduction

I learnt about built-in commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`... I learnt about the filesystem and how to navigate it.
I also learnt how to 'look around' using commands like `ls`, `less`, `file`... also, the `ln` command and its usage.
I also learnt about commands like `type`, `which`, `help`, `man`... implementing wildcards, reading man pages, creating links, setting file permissions and using keyboard shortcuts in Bash.
