# Shell Permissions

> This project was an introduction to the Shell Permissions.

## Introduction

I learnt about commands like `chmod`, `sudo`, `su`, `choan`, `chgrp` and thier usage.
Things like;
-  linux permissions and how to represent each of the three sets of permissions (_owner, group, and other_) as a single digit.
- How to create a _user_, _group_ and also print these informations.
