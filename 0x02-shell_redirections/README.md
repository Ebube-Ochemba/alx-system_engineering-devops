# Shell, I/O Redirections and filters

> This project was an introduction to Input/Output Redirections and filters.

## Introduction

I learnt abou commands like `head`, `tail`, `find`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `grep`, `tr`... and thier usage. Things like;
- How to redirect standard output to a file and How to get standard input from a file instead of the keyboard.
- How to combine commands in the Shell.
- How special characters work and how to filter text from files.
