# Loops, conditions and parsing

> This project was on shell loops, conditions and parsing.

## Summary

I learnt about how to create SSH keys, the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`, how to use `while`, `until` and `for loops`, how to use `if`, `else`, `elif` and `case` condition statements, how to use the `cut command` and what are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them.

## Files
