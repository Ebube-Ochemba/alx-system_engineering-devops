# Networking basics #0

> This project was on Networking basics.

## Summary

I learnt about the OSI Model and its 7 layers, Area networks like LAN & WAN, the Internet, IP addresses, the 2 types of IP addresses, what `localhost` subnet are and why IPv6 was created, TCP/UDP and their similiarities/differences, what the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP are (transfer level on the OSI schema), what a port is and memorized SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers, and what the `netstat` and `ping` commands do.

- [x] [4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x07-networking_basics/4-TCP_and_UDP_ports): A Bash script that displays listening ports:
	- That only shows listening sockets
	- That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs
- [x] [5-is_the_host_on_the_network](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x07-networking_basics/5-is_the_host_on_the_network): A Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.
	- Accepts a string as an argument.
	- Displays `Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}` if no argument passed.
	- Ping the IP 5 times
