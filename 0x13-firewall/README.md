- [x] [0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but): `ufw` commands used to install and setup firewall rules for `web-01`.
- [x] [100-port_forwarding](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/100-port_forwarding): Configuration for `web-01` so that its firewall redirects port `8080/TCP` to port `80/TCP`.
