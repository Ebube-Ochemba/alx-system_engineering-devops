# System engineering & DevOps - Bash

> This repository contains programs written for the system engineering and DevOps
> track at Alx.

## Description

In this repository, you will find a collection of projects and assignments that cover various topics in Devops. In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. Each project dives into a specific topic, I tackled challenges that encouraged me to get creative with solutions.
